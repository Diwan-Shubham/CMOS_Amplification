## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents the **design and AC performance analysis of a Telescopic CMOS Operational Amplifier**
using the **SkyWater 130nm (Sky130A) PDK**.  
The schematic is implemented in **Xschem**, and simulations are carried out using **NGSpice**.

The main objective is to study the **high-gain characteristics, frequency response**, and the effect of
**bias voltage, bias current, and transistor sizing (W/L)** on the amplifier performance.

## ✅ Performance Summary (Qualitative)

| Parameter | Observation                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| DC Gain   | Improved after bias & W/L tuning         |
| Bandwidth | Increased                                |
| Power     | Low (single-stage design)                |
| Stability | Inherently stable (single dominant pole) |

## 🧠 Design Insights

* Cascoding significantly increases output resistance → higher gain
* Proper biasing is critical for:

  * Keeping transistors in saturation
  * Maximizing gain
* Telescopic op-amps trade **output swing** for **high speed and gain**
* Single-stage nature avoids the need for Miller compensation


## 📚 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding telescopic op-amp architecture
* Hands-on experience with Sky130A PDK
* Biasing and sizing impact on analog performance
* AC analysis using NGSpice

## 🔍 How to Find the SKY130 Model File??

If you need to locate the SKY130 model file (`sky130.lib.spice`) on your Linux system, run this command:

```bash
sudo find / -type f -name "sky130.lib.spice" 2>/dev/null
```

This will search your entire filesystem and print the full path of the model file.
And select the appropriate path and copy to file in the schmatic.

##  How to Plot the frequency repsonse??
Enter this command in the after simulatig in the ngspcie command terminal
```bash
plot db(v(vout)/v(vip))
```
Change the names according to the pins you used in the schematic.
